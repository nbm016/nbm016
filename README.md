I performed a Bollywood Movies Analysis of Bollywood Hindi Movies, which includes a Jupyter Notebook Code File analyzing a Kaggle Dataset and PowerPoint Presentation of the Data Analysis results. 

This Bollywood Movies Data Analysis Project examines the financial outcomes (revenues, profitability), genres, box office collections, top actors and actresses, and ratings of Bollywood Hindi Movies from 2005 to 2017. Insights from this Data Analysis were used to develop conclusions and future predictions/analysis about the Bollywood Industry. 

<b>Programming Languages and Libraries:</b> Python, Pandas, SciPy Stats, Seaborn, MatPlotLib, Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab).

<b>Concepts:</b> Data Analysis, Data Gathering, Data Cleaning, Data Exploration, Data Visualizations, Hypothesis Testing.

  <li><b>Masala Mahal Final Project Website - Web Development - CMSC 335 Final Project</b><br><br>
  I created and designed a Website for an Indian Restaurant and Arts Business named “Masala Mahal”, where Indian Cuisine meets Creativity. 

Users can order Food dishes and reserve Art events of their choosing, where each user’s session gets stored in a checkout cart. Node.js and Express.js were utilized in this project to smoothly transition between different webpage endpoints. MongoDB is also used to facilitate the state of the checkout cart through storing the user’s choices. 

<b>Programming Languages and Concepts:</b> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, and APIs.
